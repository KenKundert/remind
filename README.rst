Remind schedules notification reminders. You can specify the time either using 
a specific time, such as 3:30pm, or you can specify it by the time from now in 
minutes or hours, or you can use both. So, you can say::

    remind 4pm

    remind 4pm -15m

    remind 10m

In the first case the reminder goes off at 4pm, in the second it goes off at 
3:45pm, and in the third it goes off in 10 minutes.  When the time expires
a notification is raised. You can specify the message in the notification using 
the -m or --msg option.  Or you can add the message after specifying the time.  
Any argument that cannot be processed as a time switches the argument processing 
from time to message, and all subsequent arguments are taken to be part of the 
message::

    remind 1h meet Maria

You can specify the time from now using seconds, minutes, hours, etc.  For 
example::

    remind 3h 15m

You can use *noon* and *midnight* as aliases for 12PM and 12AM.

When specifying the time of day, you can use the following formats::

    'h:mm:ss A': ex. 1:30:00 PM, 1:30:00 pm
    'h:mm:ssA': ex. 1:30:00PM, 1:30:00pm
    'h:mm A': ex. 1:30 PM, 1:30 pm
    'h:mmA': ex. 1:30PM, 1:30pm
    'hA': ex. 1PM or 1pm
    'HH:mm:ss': ex. 13:00:00
    'HH:mm': ex. 13:00

Be aware that *remind* calculates how long it must wait and then sleeps in the 
background before waking up and delivering the message after the prescribed 
amount of time has passed.  If you turn you computer off during this time the 
sleeping process will be killed and no reminder will be given, even if you turn 
your computer back on before the scheduled time.  If you put your computer to 
sleep, the sleeping remind process will not recognize the passage of time and so 
the reminder will be given late, delayed by the length of time your computer was 
asleep.

You can use pip to install the program::

    pip3 install --user schedule-reminder
